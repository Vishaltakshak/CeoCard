              You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur
              under your account or password. Because of this, we strongly
              recommend that you exit from your account at the end of each
              session. You agree to notify CeoCard immediately of any
              unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security.
              CeoCard reserves the right to refuse Membership or service,
              terminate Membership, or remove or edit content in its sole
              discretion. Notwithstanding the above, we retain the right at our

            <p>
              If your Membership application is approved, you will be charged
              based on the terms that you agreed to on your Membership
              application. You will only be charged if your application is
              approved. Your Membership fee may be subject to taxation in
              accordance with applicable federal or state law. The Membership
              fee does not include applicable taxes. We may change the
              Membership fee at any time, but changes will apply only to new and
              renewal Memberships. The Membership fee is not refundable. Prepaid
              cards will not be accepted as a valid payment method and will be
              declined.

            <p>
              The initial term of a Membership shall commence on the date it is
              purchased and continue for the duration of the agreed-upon
              Membership period. Each Membership will automatically renew
              (therein referred to as a "Renewal Membership") each Membership
              period for additional periods (referred to as "Continuous
              Membership") unless (i) you notify Member Services in writing, of
              your decision to cancel your Membership within 30 days of your
              renewal date; or (ii) we terminate your Membership.
            </p>
            <p>
              Renewal Membership fees will be billed at the end of each
              Membership period and automatically to the credit card we
              currently have on file, in the amount of the then current
              Membership fee on or around the day in which your current
              Membership or Renewal Membership term expires. If we attempt to
              charge the credit card on file in the amount of your renewal and
              the transaction fails, we may reattempt the charge for up to 60
              days from that date unless you notify CeoCard of your decision to
              cancel your Membership.

              use of such Membership would violate any provisions of this TOS,
              applicable law, or otherwise be harmful to our interests. If

              any remaining condition. Headings are for reference purposes only
              and do not limit the scope or extent of such section. This TOS and
              the relationship between you and CeoCard will be governed by the
              laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of
              law provisions. You and CeoCard agree to submit to the personal
              jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the State
              of New York with respect to any legal proceedings that may arise
              in connection with this TOS. The failure of CeoCard to act with
              respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its right to
              act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. CeoCard does
              not guarantee it will take action against all breaches of this
              TOS. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this TOS, there
              shall be no third-party beneficiaries to this TOS. This TOS
              constitutes the entire agreement between you and CeoCard and
              governs your use of the Site, superseding any prior agreements
              between you and CeoCard with respect to the Site.

              Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims
              regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in
              any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute
              arising under these Terms of Service and Membership Agreement
              shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive
              Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
              Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in
              accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in
              Austin, Texas, in the English language and the arbitral decision
              may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action
              or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs
              and attorneys’ fees. If any part of these Terms of Service and
              Membership Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part
              will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the
              remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver
              by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any
              breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or
              condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your
              rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and
              agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; CeoCard may
              assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This
              Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of
              the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
